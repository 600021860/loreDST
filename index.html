    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello hello, my name is Remy G-K, and I am currently a junior in high school. I decided to learn how to create a website 
        partially because I want to know how to create my own website for when I start working or creating something of my own, 
        if I ever do.</p>
    <p>I guess I should begin making this website with some simple things I enjoy, then. I enjoy folding origami, dancing, listening
        to music, drawing, programming, and gaming. Let's begin with those.</p>
