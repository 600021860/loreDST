    <p>Most of the information here is pulled from the fandom wiki's Storyline page for the game <b>Don't Starve Together</b>.
        I'm just making this website because this is a topic I know a lot about and I need practice building a website. I'll
        add links somewhere on this page lol.</p> <br> <br>

    <h1>The Real World</h1>
    
    <!--how the story begins: with William Carter-->
    <h2>William's Origins: 1890s-1906</h2>
    <p>This story begins with a hopeful and aspiring man named <span>William Carter</span>.</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>July 26, 1901:</b> William departs from Liverpool, England, for the United States aboard a ship named
            the <i>Quest</i>, in hopes of making a living as a stage performer.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--after the earthquake, the string of disappearances that occurs afterward-->
    <h2>Disappearances</h2>
    <p>A lot of the events listed underneath this section have unknown dates, but there is a lot of speculation as to when they occurred.
        I will distinguish between confirmed dates and speculated dates in the list below, and will have a separate list for events which we have no 
        clues as to the time of their occurrence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1906: Supposedly right after his final act, Maxwell sought George T. Witherstone as his first victim. Witherstone was in Paris at the time
            of William's attack. However, an unlucky mime named <span>Wes</span>, accidentally runs into Witherstone in an alleyway just as the man is 
            about to be pulled into The Constant. As Wes falls into the portal, two crows chasing him are taken with him as well (explaining how crows 
            arrived without Maxwell having created them). Witherstone goes about his day as if nothing happened. Additionally, we learn that Witherstone
            owns a <i>gramaphone</i>.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--how Wilson made it into The Constant-->
    <h2>Wilson's Origins</h2>
    <p><span>Wilson Percival Higgsbury</span>'s imprisonment in The Constant is pivotal to the story, changing the ways of The Constant in an unlikely
        manner.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1921: Wilson is a gentleman scientist who has isolated himself from the rest of society. Thinking he is a genius, he performs experiments in
            his cabin in the woods. To his dismay, none of his experiments seem to work. Soon enough, he hears an eerie disembodied voice emanating from
            his <i>Voxola Radio</i>, promising him some secret knowledge if he builds something in return. In an eager and desperate decision, Wilson 
            accepts the deal. He gains said knowledge and builds the contraption the voice requests. After turning the lever, shadow hands manifest and 
            pull him into The Constant.</li>
    </ul>
    
</div>
<!--the second sector: the lore from the constant-->
<div id="plot_of_the_constant">
    <h1>The Constant</h1>

    <!--a prelude to everything-->
    <h2>Prelude: History of the Constant</h2>
    <p>We are backtracking now to before Wilson, before the disappearances, before Maxwell. This section is all about the history of the ancient civilization
        which thrived in The Constant... and fell in The Constant... before Maxwell's reign. Quite a bit of this information is speculated by the community,
        however, and is still trying to be pieced together.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I pretty much know nothing about this except Metheus and Cyclum, so I'll come back to this later.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--going back to the present, here is Adventure Mode-->
    <h2>Adventure Mode</h2>
    <p>Up until this point, everything that has occurred has occurred before either of the games <span>Don't Starve</span> and <span>Don't Starve Together</span>.
        <i>Adventure Mode</i> is a game mode available in Don't Starve, the first of the two aforementioned games. This is when Don't Starve's story comes into play.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wilson wakes up in The Constant, as many before him have, and is greeted by Maxwell, The King of The Constant himself.</li>
        <li>Will come back to this later too</li>
    </ul>

    <!--the shift from Wilson's ephemeral reign to Charlie's reign-->
    <h2>A New Reign</h2>
    <p>Now that Maxwell has been freed from the throne, Wilson now has the power to control The Constant. However, just as suggested by Maxwell's condition, it is not a
        pleasant experience... it's miserable. Fortunately, Wilson does not stay here for long.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wilson is now the new King of The Constant, but he doesn't want to be here. He struggles to escape his shadowy shackles on The Nightmare Throne. It is 
            speculated that he sits here for no longer than 3 days, as at the time he is released, his beard hasn't grown at all.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--the ROT arc reveals some new things about Charlie and the light vs shadow war-->
    <p>The Return of Them arc is a series of updates that revolves around 2 pivotal themes: the moon and the ocean.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One day, the moon cracks and a piece of it breaks off, falling into the ocean. This compels Wilson, who witnessed the event, along with Winona and Wigfrid, 
            to investigate the place where the moon's fragment landed. Thus he, Winona, and Wigfrid set sail to search for the fragment. They discover a Lunar Island 
            that has been created by this peculiar lunar event.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--this arc is still going on rn-->
    <h2>Current Arc</h2>
    <p>Now we are in the real present, the arc Klei is currently developing at this moment. We don't know much yet, but we will learn more soon.</p>
