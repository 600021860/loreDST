    <!--how the story begins: with William Carter-->
    <h2>William's Origins: 1890s-1906</h2>
    <p>This story begins with a hopeful and aspiring man named <span>William Carter</span>.</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>July 26, 1901:</b> William departs from Liverpool, England, for the United States aboard a ship named
            the <i>Quest</i>, in hopes of making a living as a stage performer.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--after the earthquake, the string of disappearances that occurs afterward-->
    <h2>Disappearances</h2>
    <p>A lot of the events listed underneath this section have unknown dates, but there is a lot of speculation as to when they occurred.
        I will distinguish between confirmed dates and speculated dates in the list below, and will have a separate list for events which we have no 
        clues as to the time of their occurrence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1906: Supposedly right after his final act, Maxwell sought George T. Witherstone as his first victim. Witherstone was in Paris at the time
            of William's attack. However, an unlucky mime named <span>Wes</span>, accidentally runs into Witherstone in an alleyway just as the man is 
            about to be pulled into The Constant. As Wes falls into the portal, two crows chasing him are taken with him as well (explaining how crows 
            arrived without Maxwell having created them). Witherstone goes about his day as if nothing happened. Additionally, we learn that Witherstone
            owns a <i>gramaphone</i>.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--how Wilson made it into The Constant-->
    <h2>Wilson's Origins</h2>
    <p><span>Wilson Percival Higgsbury</span>'s imprisonment in The Constant is pivotal to the story, changing the ways of The Constant in an unlikely
        manner.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1921: Wilson is a gentleman scientist who has isolated himself from the rest of society. Thinking he is a genius, he performs experiments in
            his cabin in the woods. To his dismay, none of his experiments seem to work. Soon enough, he hears an eerie disembodied voice emanating from
            his <i>Voxola Radio</i>, promising him some secret knowledge if he builds something in return. In an eager and desperate decision, Wilson 
            accepts the deal. He gains said knowledge and builds the contraption the voice requests. After turning the lever, shadow hands manifest and 
            pull him into The Constant.</li>
    </ul>
